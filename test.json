I'm familiar with most of the concepts of ES6 like classes, arrow functions, new variable declarations, array methods (map, filter, sort, etc), spread and ternary operators, etc. While not very experienced yet I've some basic understanding of Typescript. In recent times I've adapted to modern frameworks such as React. Outside of websites I've used Javascript with Unity engine and for making some Chrome extensions."
